# Perlyscript v0.0.1 Specification

The initial version of the language is extremely tiny and not useful at all!

It specifies a parser and the language it parses

## Perlyscript Programs

A program is a single file consisting of zero or more statements

```
statement_1
statement_2
...
statement_n-1
statement_n
```

### Example

```
say(1);
say('2');
say('peekaboo!');
```

## Statements

A statement can consist only of a function call followed by a semicolon

```
function_call;
```

### Example

```
say(1)
```

## Function Calls

A function call consists of a function name and one argument enclosed in parentheses which is a literal

```
function_name()
```

### Example

```
say(1)
```

### say

This is the only function

```
say(literal)
```

#### Example

```
say('hello')
```

## Literals

Literals are data elements directly defined in a program

```
natural_number | string
```

### Example

```
123
```

### Natural Numbers

They are a positive whole number

#### Example

```
11
```

### Strings

These are a sequence of zero or more ASCII characters contained in single quotes

#### Example

```
'Hello there!'
```

## Parser

This is a program that takes a single argument, the path to a Perlyscript program. It will lex and parse the program, generating the output of parsing it

The following sections document the output of the parser for the different components of the language

### Programs

```
type: program
statements:
    - <statement_1>
    - <statement_2>
    ...
    - <statement_n-1>
    - <statement_n>
```

## Statements

There is no generic statement representation - see the specific types below

## Function Calls

A function call consists of a function name and one argument enclosed in parentheses which is a literal

```
type: functional_call
function_name: <function_name>
argument: <function_argument>
```

## Literals

There is no generic literal representation - see the specific types below

### Natural Numbers

```
type: natural_number_literal
value: <value>
```

### Strings

```
type: string_literal
value: <value>
```
